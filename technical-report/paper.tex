%% Majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and references.
%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography files in BibTeX format.
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-reference.bib file enumerating your References.

\section{Introduction}

The IMDB dataset includes information about different films and series across time. In this project the group included an external dataset called Oscar Awards from Kaggle \cite{FontesLu} to include the awards given to different crew members including directors ,actors, writers and more.  With that in mind the group designed the data warehouse to centralize over the relationship of films, crew members and awards over time. The OLAP  (Online Analytical Processing) application on the other hand tackles the analysis of these relations and the target audience for this application are for stakeholders who are involved in the film industry. These stakeholders can be venture capitalist \cite{investopedia2025vc}, directors, producers and writers.
